# Installation instructions

If you are starting a new project, please consider using our [Starter Kit](https://github.com/ViroCommunity/starter-kit) as a basis for your app.

The steps below are for manually installing and linking the library to an existing React Native project. We do not yet support auto-linking.

## Install

#### NPM 

```console
$ equationalapplications/viro#react-18
```

#### Yarn

```console
$ yarn add equationalapplications/viro#react-18
```

## Linking (You _must_ do this - we do not support auto-linking)

If you're unsure about which file to edit or where to put specified the lines, we have added links to how this is done in our [starter-kit](https://github.com/ViroCommunity/starter-kit) repo.

# **Troubleshooting**

- **It doesn't work on my iOS simulator!**

  AR _does not work on iOS simulators_. If you are getting an error that looks like:

  `ARWorldTrackingConfiguration setAutoFocusEnabled: unrecognised`

  that is expected. Sorry!

  See [running-on-device](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device) in the official react-native docs.
